# Using Your Embeddings in a Classifier (Evaluation)

Now that we have created our custom embeddings, we need to evaluate how good they are. A common technique for evaluating word embeddings is cosine similarity. For cosine similarity we calculate the angle between two vectors and take the cosine of that angle. The smaller the angle, the more similar the two vectors are, hence the more similar they are in meaning or distribution. 

\cos(\theta)={\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B}\over\|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{B}\|}
