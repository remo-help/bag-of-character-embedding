# Character Level Embeddings with GloVe

This tutorial will show you how you how to use [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. 2014) to create your own custom character-level embeddings for machine learning purposes. We will begin by discussing embeddings in general and GloVe in particular. I will then briefly discuss in what kind of a scenario we would want to do a character-level embedding, as opposed to a word-level embedding. Finally, I will walk you through an example application for the embeddings we just created.

For your convenience, this tutorial is seperated into parts. If you are just interested in a certain part, feel free to directly go to one of the links below.
